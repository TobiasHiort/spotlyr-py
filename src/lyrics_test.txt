She was always my best friend<br/>

I saw you with her again<br/>
I see pictures in my mind<br/>
I see fingers up my spine<br/>
I saw my heart break in two<br/>
I saw her again with you<br/>

<br/><br/>Exception occurred 
HTTP Error 404: Not FoundWhen I grow up <br/>
I want to be a forester <br/>
Run through the moss on high heels <br/>
That's what I'll do <br/>
Throwing out a boomerang <br/>
Waiting for it to come back to me <br/>
<br/>
When I grow up <br/>
I want to live near the sea <br/>
Crab claws and bottles of rum <br/>
That's what I'll have <br/>
Staring at a seashell <br/>
Waiting for it to embrace me <br/>
<br/>
I put my soul into what I do <br/>
Last night I drew a funny man <br/>
With dog eyes and a hanging tongue <br/>
It goes way back <br/>
I never like that sad look <br/>
From someone who wants to be loved by you <br/>
<br/>
I'm very good with plants <br/>
When my friends are away <br/>
They let me keep the soil moist <br/>
On the seventh day I rest <br/>
For a minute or two <br/>
Then back on my feet to call for you <br/>
<br/>
You've got cucumbers on your eyes <br/>
Too much time spent on nothing <br/>
Waiting for a moment to arise <br/>
The face in the ceiling <br/>
And arms too long <br/>
I'm waiting for him to catch me   <br/>
<br/>
Waiting for it to embrace me oh
